# About Us

Beats for Boobs (b::b) is a collaborative celebration of art, fashion, food, music and education whose purpose is to
raise awareness and funds for local breast cancer services organizations. We are a volunteer-led event that maintains
low-overhead in order to maximize impact in our community.

Beats for Boobs is a project of Breast Cancer Emergency Fund, a registered non-profit organization.

## History

Juliana Cochnar and Radhika Ragsdale met in San Francisco in 2003 and were inspired to make an impact for people
battling breast cancer.  Juliana shared the story of her mother, Barbara’s recent survival while Radhika shared her
sorrows about losing her aunt, Shrena Nair, to the fight. Intuitively, they envisioned celebrating Juliana’s mother’s
survival and honoring Radhika’s aunt simultaneously with an event that would gather the community of San Francisco to
raise awareness and funds for breast cancer.

Soon after that fortuitous meeting, Radhika & Juliana joined forces and amassed an army of volunteers to create the
fundraising gala, Beats for Boobs. The event proved unique in catering to a unique demographic of urban professionals,
tech leaders, alternative artists, musicians, fashion designers and young philanthropists.  Attendees celebrated
survival, honored those who had fallen, learned about cancer prevalence and prevention, and left feeling inspired to
further support the cause.

In 2005, Juliana and Radhika were approached by close friends Katherine Vicker May, Shabnum Mehra, and Summer Frundel to
form a dedicated executive team that brought fresh enthusiasm, loyalty, and expertise towards organizing what became a
yearly event that progressively surpassed goals in community attendance and contributions for local breast cancer
beneficiaries.

In 2007, Kome Muller attended the event and connected with Barbara, and soon after jumped on board to dedicate her time
and energy to the organization.

Beats for Boobs approached a new phase in history, when local volunteer Ashley Davidson moved to Seattle in 2008, and
approached the team to consider a multi-city event, knowing that Beats for Boobs would be well-received beyond San
Francisco. Commencing the role of local Event Director, Ashley assembled a team of passionate volunteers who created
Seattle’s inaugural celebration of Beats for Boobs in 2010.

Also in 2010, Breast Cancer Emergency Fund, a registered 501c3 non-profit in San Francisco became Beats for Boobs’
fiscal sponsor.  In 2011, in addition to the San Francisco and Seattle events, Los Angeles eagerly hosted its inception
of Beats for Boobs, October 2011 under the leadership of LA Event Director, Kristen Hosack.  In the true spirit and
model of Beats for Boobs, leaders Ashley, Kristen, and each of their local teams acted as Beats for Boobs ambassadors
committed to uniting their respective communities in growing awareness and support for breast cancer and local breast
cancer agencies.

In 2013, Beats for Boobs and b::b were trademarked.  Today, Beats for Boobs works with over 200 volunteers to create an
annual January gala.

Together, Beats for Boobs has granted more than $200,000 to the breast cancer community.  In 2015, Beats for Boobs ::
Turn It Up to 11! aims to donate a total of $50,000 to it's four beneficiaries.

Beats for Boobs continues to grow organically and exponentially, attracting compassionate and devoted individuals who
donate boundless energy, services, and time. We hope to see you at one of our signature events and have you join us in
joyous celebration and earnest remembrance of those impacted by breast cancer, and in support of invaluable local
breast cancer organizations.
