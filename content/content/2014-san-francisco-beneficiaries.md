### BREAST CANCER FUND

The Breast Cancer Fund works to prevent breast cancer by eliminating our exposure to toxic chemicals and radiation
linked to the disease. Drawing together the scientific evidence linking breast cancer to chemical and radiation
exposure, the Breast Cancer Fund translates this science into action that gives people practical tools to reduce their
risk, and empowers them to raise their voices to create change so that our daughters, granddaughters and planet can
thrive.
